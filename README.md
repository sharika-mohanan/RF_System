RF_Zernike.m calculates the first order spherical aberration (SA) at each 'z' for Ideal and Non-Ideal cases of RF systems
The code requires the lens parameters for the imaging and reference objective and the relay lenses.

zernike_coeffs.m and zernfun.m decomposes the wavefront into individual zernike modes. 

The final figure compares the SA at each z for the Ideal and Non-Ideal cases.
